do_acceptance.C - compares acceptance corrected quantities to assess systematic uncertainty, uses all_cumulants_acc.root
do_systematics.C - compares systematic variations to the baseline, needs special root files to be made using process_cumulants.C using special output files
fout.root - root file with the Run14AuAu event cuts
helpmecent.C - looks at acceptance based quantities as a function of centrality for Run14AuAu
helpmestrk.C - looks at acceptance based quantities as a function of NFVTXtracks for Run14AuAu
make_centrality_offsets.C - generates the code for the Q-vector recentering for Run14AuAu vs centrality
make_do_cuts.C - reads fout.root to generate code for the Run14AuAu event cuts
plot_sides.C - makes a comparison of FVTX north only, southonly, and combined (uses all_cumulants_northsouth.root)
process_cumulants.C - the main macro to create the histogram file with all of the results (all_cumulants_out.root)
process_cumulants_NS.C - special variant of process_cumulants to generate all_cumulants_northsouth.root
process_cumulants_acc.C - special variant of process_cumulants to generate all_cumulants_acc.root
process_cumulants_centrality.C - special variant of process_cumulants to do Run14AuAu vs centrality instead of NFVTXtracks
process_cumulants_old.C - old verion of process_cumulants, not sure why I'm keeping it around
process_cumulants_strk.C - special variant of process_cumulants to do Run14AuAu (derived from _centrality)
process_cumulants_v3.C - special variant of process_cumulants to do v3 instead of v2
run14auau_eventcuts.pdf - plot of Run14AuAu event cuts
simple_six_cent.C - macro to look at v2{6} in Run14AuAu vs centrality
simple_six_strk.C - macro to look at v2{6} in Run14AuAu vs NFVTXtracks
small_six.C - macro to look at v2{6} in Run16dAu
tracks_charge_function.C - output of make_do_cuts.C
