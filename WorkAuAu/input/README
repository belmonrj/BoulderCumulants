10577 missing essential histograms
10595 and 10595m confirmed same


10595 from January
11078 from April
11177 from May
11508 added Jin's track selections
11511 same but with new Q-vector recentering
11539 removed Jamie's event cuts (was a mistake to leave them in)
11540 same but with new Q-vector recentering (looked bad)
11552 added new event cuts (looked much better, additional recentering not needed)
11596 added double track cut
11601 added recursion
11609 added 2sub 4part stuff (has some mistakes)
11612 fixed some typos
11617 fixed some typos
11644 fixed some typos (2sub 4part stuff works here)
11649 attempted Q-vector recentering on recursion (works poorly, need to update to arm-by-arm)
11653
11660

the 117* series have incomplete statistics due to serious taxi problems
11724 systematic baseline
11725 sysetmatic z-vertex
11726 systematic chi2ndf
11727 systematic nhits

11809 new histograms for centrality-nfvtxt study
11811 new histograms for centrality-nfvtxt study
11972 added recursion histograms for v3, v4, SC(2,3), SC(2,4)
11976 fixed typo for resursion v4
12097 added some histograms for analytical acceptance calculations for v3
12185 same as 12097 but 0.5 cm DCA cut
12194 same as 12097 but 3.0 chi2ndf cut
12195 same as 12097 but 5.0 zvtx cut
12203 same as 12097 but 4 nhits cut

12289 same as 12203 but with different nfvtxt counting (to match baseline)
12290 same as 12185 but with different nfvtxt counting (to match baseline)

12420 default cuts
12432 default cuts but with run by run Q-vector (re)recentering

12555 default cuts, fewer histograms and radically reorganized code
12579 same as 12555 but with added diagnostics, Q-vector recentering, and weighting test histograms

12581 same as 12579 but with Q-vector offsets removed and improved histogram range
12582 same as 12581 but pro.109 data set (405XXX-408XXX)
1258A merge of 12581 and 12582

12587 same as 12581 but with Q-vector recentering as a function of nfvtxt

12634 same as 12587 but with a bunch of histograms added back in

12643 same as 12534 but with dca cut 0.5, chi2 cut 3.0, Q-vector recentering removed
12650 same as 12643 but with Q-vector recentering put back in (as function of nfvtxt)



13617 baseline cuts, no Q-vector recentering, pro109

13792 standard baseline, refresh, pro104
13795 attempted but failed q-vector recentering (offsets file in CVS but not picked up by taxi), numerically identical to 13792
13798 same as 13795
13799 same as 13798 but with successful q-vector recentering (tried it the old way with numerical constants stored in the code)
